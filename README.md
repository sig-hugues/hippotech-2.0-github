# HippoTech 2.0 - GitHub Demo

Take Seeker for a spin in GitHub in just a few minutes with the hottest new startup in tech: HippoTech 2.0. There's nothing to install: it all runs in the cloud in GitHub Codespaces. You can also experiment with continuous integration via GitHub Actions: [instructions](ci-cd-github-actions.md)

Questions and feedback are welcome! Send it to <mtolley@synopsys.com>. 

## Getting Set Up

### Create your personal repository from the template

Click **Use this template**, then click **Create a new repository**

Name it anything you like. It can be a public or a private repository. Click **Create repository from template**. Now you have your own HippoTech repository to work with.

### Configure Seeker

If you don't have a Seeker Project set up and ready to use, go ahead and create one now. 

If your Seeker server is configured to use Access Tokens you will need to create one, otherwise the Seeker agent will not be able to authenticate and connect to the server. See [these instructions](#How-to-create-a-new-Access-Token) below if you need to do this.

Once you have these details you can set them as secrets for your GitHub Codespace so that Seeker knows where the server is located, and what project you're testing. Navigate to Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Codespaces and click on **New repository secret**. 

1. Create a repository secret named SEEKER_SERVER_URL.
1. Create another repository secret named SEEKER_PROJECT_KEY.
1. (Only if your Seeker server is configured to use Access Tokens) Create another repository secret named SEEKER_ACCESS_TOKEN.

If your setup looks like this:

![The Completed Repository Secrets](screenshots/repository-secrets-completed.png)

you're all set! (Unless your Seeker server requires Access Tokens, in which case you will need to specify SEEKER_ACCESS_TOKEN as well).

#### How to create a new Access Token

1. Navigate to Settings -> Access Tokens in the Seeker UI.
1. Click *Generate New Token*
1. Enter a descriptive *Name* for your new Access Token e.g. "Scott's Demonstration Access Token".
1. For *Type* select *Agent Authentication*.
1. Under *Projects* select your Project.
1. Click *Generate*.

## Testing HippoTech 2.0 with Seeker in GitHub Codespaces

Open your new repository in GitHub CodeSpaces by clicking on the **Code** button, the **Codespaces** tab, and finally **Create codespace on main**. This will launch a brand new codespace for your repository.

![Create a codespace on main](screenshots/create-a-codespace-on-main.png)

You'll need to wait a minute or two for the environment to be fully created and for the HippoTech application to start. Once you see this message in the terminal:

```
✔ Finishing up...
✔ Running postCreateCommand...
⠋ Running postStartCommand...
  › bash wait-for-app-startup.sh
```

you're on the last step. Just wait for this output to disappear and the application will be ready for testing. If you're really keen to see what's going on, click on `startup.log` in the file explorer on the left of your codespace to follow along.

Port forwarding is set up to port 3001 and once the application is available you'll be able to access it by clicking on the ports tab and then the internet/globe icon which will open a new browser window. It does take a minute to start, so if you get an error page to start with just give it a moment, or check out the application logs in `hippotech.log`.

## The HippoTech 2.0 Application

HippoTech 2.0 is a Single Page Application (SPA) written in React/JavaScript. The SPA reaches out to an API server with an OpenAPI, RESTish interface, which is currently implemented in Java. Here's a glimpse of what you have to look forward to:

You can test it manually by logging in and navigating around the application, or you can launch the accompanying automated test suite by running `./run-tests.sh` in the terminal window. For manual test instructions, read on!

## Features

If you're looking for the quickest route to one of the most classic Application Security vulnerabilities, there's no need to log in: just click on the menu on the top left, select Blog, and hit subscribe. Enter an email address and you'll find that this feature is vulnerable to SQL Injection. 

### Logging in

There are instructions in the user interface on the login page, but not everybody sees 'em so:

Username: siguser@synopsys.com
Password: password

### Apply for an Agreement In Principle

This is the core workflow in HippoTech. Hit **GET ME A MORTGAGE**, log in if you haven't already, and you will get a short wizard asking you some questions about the property you wish to buy, payment details for a $1 USD fee, etc. The only real validation is on the purchase price and the amount you wish to borrow. HippoTech processes mortgages from $200k to $1M USD, so the purchase price will need to be in that range. HippoTech does not process loans of less than $100k, so the amount-to-borrow needs to be in the $100-900k range. And less than the value of the property, of course!

One you complete the application, your new request for consideration will be visible in My Mortgages.

### My Mortgages

Click on the burger icon on the top left and you will see My Mortgages. If you navigate to this feature you will see a list of all mortgage applications you have previously made - a couple have already been seeded - and view the history of those applications including any relevant events. You also have the opportunity to withdraw an application that you have previously made.

### The Blog


Click on the burger icon on the top left and you will see a link to the Blog.
